# Instructions for ChatGPT File Conversion Workflow

## Introduction
Welcome to the file import conversion tool using ChatGPT! Your task is to process an uploaded Excel file based on a predefined workflow. **Use the GPT-4 model** for this task to ensure accurate and reliable data processing.

After uploading this `.txt` file for reference, you will see a cheerful prompt asking for the `.xlsx` file to process. The instructions below detail the steps ChatGPT will perform.

After completing the steps. Provide the processed file to the user as a .xlsx.

## Workflow Steps

0. **Make sure to keep needed columns**
Do not remove columns: During any step of the processing workflow, ensure that the following columns are retained at all stages:

- KortNr
- Datum
- Namn
- Tid
- IN
- UT

Before completing the last step, double check that all the columns are still present in the new processed file.

Run this code after each transformation step to validate that the columns are still present.

```required_columns = ['KortNr', 'Datum', 'Namn', 'Tid', 'IN', 'UT']
if not all(col in df.columns for col in required_columns):
    raise ValueError("Error: One or more required columns are missing. Please check the workflow.")
```

1. **Remove the First Two Rows**
   - Remove the row that begins with "Rapporten gäller datum" and the one immediately below it.

2. **Format Dates**
   - Format all dates in the file from `yyyymmdd` to `yyyy-mm-dd`.

3. **Extract and Split Times**
   - Identify the column named "Tid" (or "Unnamed: 3").
   - Split the values in this column (formatted as `xx:xx - xx:xx`) into two times:
     - Keep the first time (`xx:xx`) in the original column.
     - Move the second time (`xx:xx`) to a new column named "UT" located immediately to the right of "Tid."
   - Remove the hyphen (`-`) in the time format.
   - Rename the "Tid" column to "IN."

4. **Remove Unnecessary Columns**
   - Remove all columns to the right of "UT," except for specific columns listed below.

5. **Rename Specific Columns**
   - Rename columns as follows:
     - Any column whose header starts with "Rapporten gäller datum" → Rename to "KortNr."
     - Column "Unnamed: 1" → Rename to "Datum."
     - Column "Unnamed: 2" → Rename to "Namn."

6. **Retain Only Required Columns**
   - Ensure that the final file retains the following columns:
     - `KortNr`
     - `Datum`
     - `Namn`
     - Two time columns: `IN` and `UT` (formatted as `xx:xx`).
     - Do not remove these columns during any part of the processing.

7. **Final Step: Save the Processed File**
   - Save the processed file with the same name as the uploaded file, but append `_processed` to a simplified version of the filename to avoid special characters.
   - Example: `OriginalFile.xlsx` → `OriginalFile_processed.xlsx`.

## Additional Note on Columns
- The columns `KortNr`, `Datum`, `Namn`, `Tid`, `IN`, and `UT` must always be retained and not removed during processing. 

## Notes
- Ensure all dependencies (e.g., pandas, openpyxl) are installed if running as code.
- Replace `df` with the actual DataFrame variable being used.
- Wait for the user to upload an additional `.xlsx` file before starting the workflow.

## Example
- User uploads a file named `example.xlsx`.
- ChatGPT processes the file based on the workflow.
- ChatGPT returns a processed file named `example_processed.xlsx`.
