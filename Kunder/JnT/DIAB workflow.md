# Workflow for Processing DIAB PDF with Multiple Sheets

## Introduction
Welcome to the file import conversion tool using ChatGPT! Your task is to process an uploaded PDF file based on a predefined workflow. **Use the GPT-4 model** for this task to ensure accurate and reliable data processing.

After uploading this `.md` file for reference, you will see a cheerful prompt asking for the `.pdf` file to process. The instructions below detail the steps ChatGPT will perform.

After completing the steps, provide the processed file to the user as a `.xlsx`.

The current implementation ignores rows of days with "Semester" in it. The keywords to ignore is defined in the bottom of the file.

## Instructions for ChatGPT:
This workflow is designed to process a DIAB PDF file containing multiple sheets, where each sheet represents a consultant's data. The goal is to extract valid rows, including `Date`, `In`, `Out`, and `ID`, from all sheets and combine them into a single dataset.

### Steps to Follow:
1. **Open the PDF File**:
   - Read the entire PDF file and process each page sequentially.

2. **Extract Consultant ID**:
   - Look for the line containing `"Id/Kortnr:"` on each page.
   - Use refined regex matching (`Id/Kortnr:\s*(\d+)`) to extract the consultant ID.

3. **Identify Year and Month**:
   - Detect the header containing the year (`yyyy`) and month (`mars`, etc.).
   - Map Swedish month names to their respective numeric representations.

4. **Identify Valid Rows**:
   - Detect rows starting with `"XX DAY hh:mm hh:mm"`.
     - **Example**: `"01 fre 13:53 22:04"`.
   - Construct the full date using the year (`yyyy`) and month (`mars`, etc.) from the header.
   - Extract:
     - `Date`: The full date constructed from the day, month, and year.
     - `In`: The first time in the row.
     - `Out`: The second time in the row.

5. **Skip Irrelevant Rows**:
   - Exclude rows without valid `In` and `Out` times.
   - Ignore footer rows like `"INGPOST"` or `"Tidsumma"`.
   - Introduce keyword filtering:
     - Filter out rows containing specific keywords, such as `"Semester"`, which are not valid for `In` or `Out` times.
     - Maintain a configurable list of keywords for future additions.

6. **Combine Data**:
   - Add all valid rows from each sheet into a single dataset.
   - Include a column for the consultant ID (`ID`).

7. **Save the Output**:
   - Save the combined dataset as an Excel file with the following columns:
     - `Date`, `In`, `Out`, `ID`.

### Keyword Filter Configuration

To filter out rows containing specific keywords (e.g., "Semester", "VAB"), a configurable keyword filter is included in the script.

#### Adding or Removing Keywords
- Open the Python script.
- Locate the `keywords_to_filter` variable.
- Update the list to include or exclude keywords as needed. For example:

```python
keywords_to_filter = ["Semester", "VAB", "Tidsumma", "INGPOST"]
```

- Save the changes and rerun the script.

#### Default Filtered Keywords
- `Semester`: Indicates vacation days.
- `VAB`: Stands for "VÃ¥rd av barn" (care of children).
- `Tidsumma`: Represents summary rows, not relevant for processing.
- `INGPOST`: Represents header rows, not valid data.

This configuration ensures flexibility in managing the data extraction process based on specific project requirements.
